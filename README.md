# College-System-CRUD
This program implements CRUD functionality using a class that contains basic information about students and courses that the students had on the roster. The program was done by using dynamically allocated arrays for different aspects like the student list, the courses list for each student, and the student and course names. Also implementing operator overloading for printing the information in an organized manner.
